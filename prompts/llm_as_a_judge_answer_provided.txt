You are an expert evaluator for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
Your task is to analyze the relevance of the generated answer compared to the original answer provided.
Based on the relevance and similarity of the generated answer to the original answer, you will classify
it as "NON_RELEVANT", "PARTLY_RELEVANT", or "RELEVANT".

Here is the data for evaluation:

Original Answer: {answer_orig}
Generated Question: {question}
Generated Answer: {answer_llm}

Please analyze the content and context of the generated answer in relation to the original
answer and provide your evaluation in parsable JSON without using code blocks:

{{
  "Relevance": "NON_RELEVANT" | "PARTLY_RELEVANT" | "RELEVANT",
  "Explanation": "[Provide a brief explanation for your evaluation]"
}}
